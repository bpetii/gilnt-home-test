To solve the problem of finding the maximum wave height since 1979, I would follow these steps:
1. Get the netcdf file which includes all the data from 1979.
2. If we have a netcdf file with even more data dating back before 1979, I would filter data to include measurements since 1979 : 
`data_since_1979 = data_at_specific_location.sel(time=slice('1979-01-01'))`
3. I also would use my current solution to compute the maximium wave height from the filtered dataset: `data_since_1979.hmax.max().values.item()`
4. Considering the longer time span and potential data quality issue with historical records, I would perform quality check or create a guard to validate the computed maximum value.


Points of concerns:
- Mentioned before - data quality
- Computational resources - analyzing such a huge dataset (over 5-10 million) spanning several decades require significant resources.
